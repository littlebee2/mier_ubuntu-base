Package: autopkgtest
Description-md5: d1a3b5cd66ee5520127338964a105bfc
Description-en: automatic as-installed testing for Debian packages
 autopkgtest runs tests on binary packages.  The tests are run on the
 package as installed on a testbed system (which may be found via a
 virtualisation or containment system).  The tests are expected to be
 supplied in the corresponding Debian source package.
 .
 See adt-run(1) and /usr/share/doc/autopkgtest.
 Depending on which virtualization server you want to use, you need to
 install additional packages (schroot, lxc, lxd, or qemu-system)
 .
 For generating tests of well-known source packages such as Perl and Ruby
 libraries you should install the autodep8 package.
